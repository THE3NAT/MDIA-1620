<b>Confusing Things</b>
1. The steps I need to go through in order to git push
2. Life as a whole tbh. Adulting is kinda BS ngl
3. Dark matter, thats shits wild

<b>Solid Understanding</b>
1. Playing around with the very small amount of code I do understand
2. Asking both you & my many friends in comp sci for help
3. Everything else (I am a genius)
